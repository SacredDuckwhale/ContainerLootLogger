# Project Description

**ContainerLootLogger** was originally designed to track the contents of the WOD Garrison's Salvage Crates (which it still does). Since then, it has been mostly rewritten to also track Legion's Order Hall mission gold earned and Order Resources spent.

# Project Status
It is currently very much unfinished, but should be usable with the little functionality it provides.

# How to use
Type **/cll** or **/containerlootlogger** ingame to see what commands are available.

# GitHub
Development happens on GitHub: [Link to the repository](https://github.com/SacredDuckwhale/ContainerLootLogger) - Feel free to contribute or check out my other addons!
